# .NetDeveloper-on-mac
Here we go .NET developer is someone who uses Microsoft's .NET framework to create software. This framework offers tools and libraries that make it easier to build Windows apps, web services, mobile apps, and more.

Imagine you're building a LEGO castle. The .NET framework is like a big box of specialized LEGO blocks that helps you put together your castle faster and more efficiently. You still have to know where each piece goes, but you don't have to make the pieces yourself.
You'll often use languages like C# (C-Sharp) when working in .NET. You can code on a Mac, but it's more commonly done on Windows. On a Mac, I can still use .NET Core, which is a cross-platform version of .NET.
Install .NET SDK: Now you'll install the Software Development Kit (SDK) for .NET. In the terminal, run: brew install --cask dotnet-sdk . 
Version check run dotnet --version
Project: Let's create a simple "Hello World" project. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to create a project and run: dotnet new console -o HelloWorld
This will create a new folder named "HelloWorld" with a console project inside.
Run the Project: Navigate into the project folder and run: cd HelloWorld
dotnet run
Open the Code: In your HelloWorld folder, you'll see a file named Program.cs. Open it in a text editor. I prefer nane command - nano Program.cs
Modify my Code: In Program.cs
